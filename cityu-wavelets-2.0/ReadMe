1. Download and Unpack source codes of FFTW and OpenCV. Suppose the root directories are 'fftw/' and 'opencv/' respectively.
2. Build FFTW.
  2.1) Enter fftw/.
  2.2) Run commnds below one by one. 'fftw$' is prompt.
       fftw$ ./configure
       fftw$ make
       fftw$ make install
       
       Note: the third command need ROOT previlege.

  2.3) If commands run OK, the FFTW would be installed in default directory. In Linux, the libraries would be in /usr/local/lib, while
       the headers would be in /usr/local/include

3. Build OpenCV
   3.1) create and enter opencv_build/
   3.2) Run commnds below one by one.
        opencv_build$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../opencv
        opencv_build$ make
        opencv_build$ make install
       
        Note: the third command need ROOT previlege.

   3.3) If commands run OK, the OpenCV would be installed in default directory. In Linux, the libraries would be in /usr/local/lib, while
        the headers would be in /usr/local/include

4. Build Our Own Package.
   4.1) Enter cityu-wavelets-2.0/
   4.2) If logining server by ssh, command of 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib/dir' should be executed.
   4.2) Open the txt file of 'MakeFile' and check if the path following '-I' in line of 'CPP_FLAGS' is where the headers above are installed.
        Also, check if the path following '-L' in line of 'LD_FLAGS' is where the libraries above are installed.
        For example, if in Linux, the two lines should look like below,

	export CPP_FLAGS=-g -Wall -O3 -I/usr/local/include
	export LD_FLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib

   4.3) Run command
        opencv$ make -f MakeFile

   4.4) If everything is OK, you will see executable file 'cityu-wavelets-2.0' in current directory.

5. Usage.
   If compiling is ok, 'cwt2' is generated. It support different subcommands.
   5.1) denoise
     This is an example command.
     $ cwt2 denoise -cfg batch_denoise.txt
     The option of '-cfg' indicates the configuration file the 'denoise' command requires, in which specifies all necessary parameters for doing denoising.
     Refer to batch_denoise.txt for details about how to customize the configuration file.
